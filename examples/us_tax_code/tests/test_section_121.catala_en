@Testing paragraph (a)@

In the first test, we define a property sold for $250,000 and who has been 
owned and used for four years straight: (a) applies.

/*
declaration scope Test1:
  context scope121 scope Section121

scope Test1:
  definition scope121.date_of_sale_or_exchange equals |01/01/2021|
  definition scope121.gain_from_sale_or_exchange_of_property equals $250,000
  definition scope121.property_ownage equals [Period {
    -- begin: |01/01/2017|
    -- end: |01/01/2021|
  }]
  definition scope121.property_usage_as_principal_residence equals [Period {
    -- begin: |01/01/2017|
    -- end: |01/01/2021|
  }]
  assertion scope121.income_excluded_from_gross_income = $250,000
*/

In the second test, we assume the property was only used for one year in the 
last five years: (a) does not apply.
